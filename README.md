# AutoTextInput Python Script
This is a quick Python script to input text after several seconds

In order to create this into an exe file I personally use "Pyinstaller" which will allow you to create a single exe file.

Here is an example command if you are in the directory of the pyinstaller.exe
If you have a logo in the same folder as the pyinstaller.exe you can use just the filename ex: "Logo.ico" instead of the full path

".\pyinstaller.exe --noconsole --onefile --windowed "C:\*Directorypath*\AutoTextInput2.py" --icon="C:\*Directorypath*\Logo.ico""


# Premade EXEs
If you prefer to just have a working EXE I have included them, but you will not have a custom logo, it will be the CUSD seal
